# üß† When Should You Combine Services in One Module?
# ‚úÖ Combine Services When‚Ä¶	                                            ‚ùå Separate Services When‚Ä¶
# They're tightly related (e.g. S3 + CloudFront)	                    Services are used in multiple projects
# You want to reuse the whole combo	                                    You want reusability for a single piece (e.g. WAF policy)
# They deploy together (need same lifecycle)	                        You might mix/match parts independently later
# The logic is tightly coupled (e.g. CloudFront needs S3 bucket ARN)	You're building more complex, modular architectures
